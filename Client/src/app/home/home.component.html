<h1>Watchlist App</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Watchlist Application.
  You must login to be able to use the application.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>You can create multiple watchlists</p></li>
  <li><p>You can add multiple titles to each watchlist</p></li>
  <li><p>You can select whether a title on the watchlist has been watched or not</p></li>
  <li><p>Items in the watchlist are originally ordered by creation date</p></li>
  <li><p>There is no save button, each watchlist changes when a title has been added or removed, or a title's watche checkbox is selected or deselected</p></li>
</ul>
<!--
<p>To help you get started, we've also set up:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Client-side navigation</strong>. For example, click <em>Counter</em> then <em>Back</em> to return here.</li>
  <li><strong>Angular CLI integration</strong>. In development mode, there's no need to run <code>ng serve</code>. It runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient production builds</strong>. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your <code>dotnet publish</code> configuration automatically invokes <code>ng build</code> to produce minified, ahead-of-time compiled JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ClientApp</code> subdirectory is a standard Angular CLI application. If you open a command prompt in that directory, you can run any <code>ng</code> command (e.g., <code>ng test</code>), or use <code>npm</code> to install extra packages into it.</p>
